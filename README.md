# Module 3: JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

This week's challenge tasks us with writing JavaScript code that will operate a Password Generator. Window prompts appear that ask the user for password criteria based on the user's request. The user has provided HTML and CSS files that will be affected by the code I write.

User Story:
* AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

* It is done:
WHEN I have written code in JavaScript that will operate on the provided HTML and CSS in order to produce a password generator according the the user's criteria. This criteria also includes a clean and polished user interface. Also, there should be NO errors when viewed in the console while using Chrome DevTools.
